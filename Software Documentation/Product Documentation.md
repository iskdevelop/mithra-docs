# Overview

Mithra is a next-generation presentation, meeting, and educational platform designed specifically for the scientific community. It enables seamless global interaction, fostering collaboration, innovation, and engagement in research, education, and professional discourse. This document outlines Mithra's core attributes, functional and non-functional requirements, user experience research, and architecture design principles.

# Defining Mithra

Mithra is built to facilitate meetings and presentations, including academic lectures, educational workshops, research group discussions, and professional exchanges among scientists, educators, and students. It bridges the gap between conventional presentation tools and specialized scientific workflows, ensuring a more intuitive and productive experience.

## Similar Products in Mithra's Business Scope

While Mithra shares functionalities with various existing platforms, it goes beyond their limitations by tailoring features specifically for scientific and academic communities. Comparable solutions include:

- **Coursera** – Course creation and structured learning.
- **Google Classroom, Blackboard** – Enrolled-only courses and educational management.
- **Google Meet, Zoom** – Live, unscheduled meetings and video conferencing.
- **BigBlueButton, Google Meet + Jamboard** – Interactive sharing of screens, webcams, files, and collaborative canvases.

Mithra does not merely replicate these functionalities but extends and refines them to suit academic and research-centric workflows.

# Distinctive Traits

Mithra introduces several unique features that enhance dynamism, engagement, and suitability for scientific interactions. These traits are further explored in the Functional Requirements Document, but an overview is provided here.

## Mithra Presentation Model

Mithra transforms the traditional presentation paradigm by making it:

- **Dynamic** – Presentations are not confined to static rendered documents (e.g., PDFs). Content can be created live, modified on demand, and adjusted interactively to enhance engagement.
- **Interactive** – Presentations integrate live web components, enabling real-time interactions such as executing code, embedding simulations, and making annotations based on audience input.
- **Extendable** – Mithra supports modular extensions that adapt to different academic needs, discussed in the Extendability section.

## Mithra as a Social Platform

Beyond meetings and presentations, Mithra functions as a **knowledge-sharing hub**. Users can:

- Build professional profiles and academic portfolios.
- Create, fork, and improve lectures and courses collaboratively.
- Engage in **meta-discussions**, refining content collectively rather than in isolated silos.

This approach mirrors **GitHub for developers**, but for lectures and scientific content. Instead of each person maintaining separate lecture notes on quantum mechanics, Mithra integrates references **within** the lectures, crediting authors dynamically.

Mithra also offers monetization options, such as donations, subscriptions, and paid enrollments, ensuring sustainability while rewarding contributors.

## Mithra’s Distinction for the Scientific Community

Unlike mainstream platforms, Mithra is **purpose-built** for academia:

- **Native LaTeX support** for seamless scientific and mathematical writing.
- **Integration with scientific tools and software**, allowing real-time data visualization, coding, and simulations.
- **Enhanced meeting structures** to accommodate the intricate nature of academic discussions, which often involve extensive side notes, clarifications, and shared workspaces.

Mithra is designed for presentations and meetings within the scientific community, but it does not aim to fill the gap of an **IDE-equivalent** collaboration tool. Instead, that role will be fulfilled by Koncept, an **Integrated Research Environment (IRE)** and the next product in the ISK Ecosystem, which will provide a dedicated space for research teams to think, write, and interact with computational tools seamlessly. But Mithra can make scientific communities communicate more delicate.

## Commitment to Open Collaboration

Mithra embodies the philosophy of **open collaboration**, fostering a globally accessible platform where knowledge creation and dissemination are unrestricted. Open collaboration refers to systems where participants voluntarily cooperate to develop content, much like **open-source software** development.

Drawing inspiration from Richard Stallman’s **GNU Manifesto** and Eric S. Raymond’s **The Cathedral and the Bazaar**, Mithra introduces **public/open-lectures** as an innovative approach to knowledge exchange. This enables:

- The development of **an open university model**, where lectures and educational resources are freely accessible.
- Collaborative enhancement of scientific knowledge, similar to Wikipedia’s role in general information dissemination.

# Mithra Extendability

Mithra is designed to be modular and expandable, allowing users to tailor it to their needs. Key extension areas include:

## AI Integration

Mithra incorporates AI-driven enhancements, such as:

- **Automated transcription and translation** for multilingual accessibility.
- **Context-aware recommendations** for related research and lecture materials.
- **Smart summarization** of discussions and presentations, reducing cognitive load for participants.

## Plugin Ecosystem

A **plugin system** enables third-party developers to create tools that extend Mithra’s capabilities, including:

- **Custom scientific tools** – Real-time equation solvers, dataset visualizers, and interactive simulations.
- **Enhanced collaboration features** – Version control for lectures, co-authoring tools, and peer review mechanisms.
- **Adaptive learning modules** – Personalized educational paths based on user engagement and progress.

## Marketplace

Mithra includes a **marketplace** where users can:

- Discover and install plugins tailored to their field of study.
- Access premium educational content and specialized lecture modules.
- Monetize unique tools, plugins, and courses through a revenue-sharing model.

# End Note

Mithra is not just another presentation tool—it is a paradigm shift for scientific communication. By integrating **dynamic presentations, open collaboration, AI-enhanced interactions, and modular extendability**, Mithra aims to redefine how researchers, educators, and students connect globally. With its focus on **scientific accuracy, interactive learning, and open-access knowledge**, Mithra has the potential to become the central hub for academia and research-driven communities worldwide.

Mithra is more than a tool; it is a **movement toward a new era of scientific collaboration and education**.
